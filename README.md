# About me
# Currently I am studying Computer Science and Economics at the
# Hochschule MÃ¼nchen. Before, I completed my bachelors degree in Graphic Design and collected some work experience as a designer. My plan for the future is to combine these two fields. So I decided to test and improve my skills with this project.
# 
# Personal goals
# By implementing this project I want to repeat and develop the skills I acquired this semester relating to software development and engineering. Additionally I want to simulate the implementation process between design and devolpment of a software solution.
# Parts of the project:
# - create a software requirement specification (SRS)
# - implementation of the desktop application
# - implementation of the mobile service
# - implementation of the synchronisation between desktop and mobile
# - designing the mobile application (perhaps desktop application as well)
# 
# Software in use
# - LibreOffice for SRS
# - Visual Paradigm for Diagrams
# - Java (Kotlin) for logic implementation
# - Adobe XD for Prototyping
# - Adobe XD for Design
